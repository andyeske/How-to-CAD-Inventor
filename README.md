# How to CAD Almost Anything: MIT IAP 2026
Welcome to How to CAD Almost Anything! Inventor edition. In this repository, you'll find the workshop's slides, recordings and Autodesk Inventor files.

## Workshop Summary

Ever wondered how are objects from our daily lives designed? How can we generate a computer 3D model of a classic iPod, a Play Station controller, or a LEGO Tower Bridge? What about designing the Taipei 101 tower? A banana? In this fun MIT IAP 2026 workshop, you will learn the skills to design all of these, and much more! 

Split into 6 2-hour long sessions, the first half of each session will be spent learning new [Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview?mktvar002=5659199|SEM|292754951|22909552031|kwd-28960010&utm_source=GGL&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=GGL_D-M_All-Products_AMER_US_eComm_SEM_BR_NEW_EX_0000_5659199&utm_id=5659199&utm_term=kwd-28960010&term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription&mkwid=s|pcrid|751580510832|pkw|autodesk%20inventor|pmt|e|pdv|c|slid||pgrid|22909552031|ptaid|kwd-28960010|pid|&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=bing&utm_campaign=GGL_INVENTOR_US_BR_SEM_EXACT&utm_term=autodesk%20inventor&utm_content=s|pcrid|751580510832|pkw|autodesk%20inventor|pmt|e|pdv|c|slid||pgrid|22909552031|ptaid|kwd-28960010|&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=292754951&gbraid=0AAAAADx7pE2cdZCCdZ1P_KaZAMuraKM73&gclid=CjwKCAjwvO7CBhAqEiwA9q2YJb1ClC7VpTMy3-TLLJW4U577G3Ma3BbAYx17F1xF1IfAtHRNAsC68hoC3CQQAvD_BwE) skills, while the second half will see the application of these new skills through in-class activities, with a focus on reverse engineering. In contrast to traditional mechanical design courses, this workshop places greater emphasis on the design process itself, understanding how we can plan and best leverage our available tools to arrive to our desired result. Thus, the sessions are less about following the instructions on an engineering drawing, and more about independent thinking and strategizing, reverse engineering an object into a 3D model. 

_This course is a sibling version of the original ["How to CAD Almost Anything"](https://github.com/andyeske/How-to-CAD-Almost-Anything) course, adapted into 6, 2-hour long sessions. This course is intended for both existing Solidworks (or other CAD software) users looking to learn a new CAD software, as well as new users trying to learn how to CAD)_.
